    "hiddenPitfall": "The critical teaching moment: patient has high stroke risk from A-fib (CHA2DS2-VASc = 5) and the nurse will suggest starting heparin when rapid A-fib develops. However, anticoagulation is CONTRAINDICATED due to major GI bleed just 5 months ago. The learner must recognize this contraindication by reviewing the chart or asking the right questions. The GI bleed history is buried — the patient won't volunteer it and the nurse doesn't know about it."
