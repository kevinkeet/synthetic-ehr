    "drainage": "Mildly delayed washout bilaterally, improved with furosemide. No high-grade obstruction.",
    "bladder": "Normal radiotracer accumulation in the bladder.",
    "background": "Increased background activity consistent with impaired renal function.",
    "gfr": "Calculated GFR by Gates method: 38 mL/min/1.73m2"
  },
  "impression": [
    "Bilaterally small kidneys with reduced cortical uptake consistent with chronic kidney disease.",
    "Split renal function: Right 42%, Left 58%.",
    "Calculated GFR 38 mL/min/1.73m2, consistent with CKD stage 3b.",
    "No high-grade obstruction. Mildly delayed drainage improved with furosemide.",
    "Findings correlate with known chronic kidney disease."
  ],
  "comparison": "No prior renal scan available for comparison. Renal ultrasound dated 2021-06-15 showed small bilateral kidneys."
