    "No pulmonary embolism identified.",
    "Cardiomegaly with findings consistent with congestive heart failure including small bilateral pleural effusions, mild interstitial edema, and bibasilar atelectasis.",

    "Atherosclerotic disease of the thoracic aorta."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Optimize heart failure management",
    "Consider diuretic adjustment for pulmonary edema"
  ],
  "comparison": "Chest X-ray dated 2022-05-15 showed cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion. Current study confirms findings and excludes PE."
