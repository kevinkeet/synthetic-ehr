  "indication": "Atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation therapy, evaluate for silent cerebral infarcts",
  "technique": "Multiplanar, multisequence MRI of the brain was performed before and after the administration of 15 mL Gadavist IV contrast. Sequences include axial T1, T2, FLAIR, DWI, SWI, sagittal T1, and post-contrast axial and coronal T1.",

      "grayMatter": "Normal cortical gray matter signal and thickness.",
      "whiteMatted": "Moderate periventricular and subcortical white matter T2/FLAIR hyperintensities consistent with chronic microvascular ischemic changes. Fazekas grade 2.",
      "acuteInfarct": "No acute infarct on DWI. No restricted diffusion identified.",

  "impression": [
    "Moderate chronic microvascular ischemic white matter changes (Fazekas grade 2).",
    "Chronic lacunar infarcts in the left basal ganglia and right centrum semiovale, likely related to underlying hypertension and atrial fibrillation.",

    "Mild generalized volume loss appropriate for age.",

  "recommendations": [
    "Continue anticoagulation for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation",
