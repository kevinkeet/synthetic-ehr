  "status": "Final",
  "radiologist": "Dr. Patricia Lee",
  "orderingProvider": "Dr. James Wilson",
  "indication": "Coronary artery disease, heart failure, evaluate for ischemia and viability",
  "technique": "Rest and pharmacologic stress myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging was performed using Tc-99m sestamibi. Regadenoson was administered for pharmacologic stress. Gated SPECT images were obtained at rest.",
  "protocol": {
    "stressAgent": "Regadenoson 0.4 mg IV",
    "stressResponse": "Heart rate increased from 68 to 95 bpm. Blood pressure 142/78 at baseline, 138/72 at peak stress.",
    "symptoms": "Patient reported mild chest tightness during stress, resolved spontaneously within 2 minutes.",
    "ecg": "Baseline: Atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response. Stress: Non-specific ST-T changes, no diagnostic ST depression."
  },
  "findings": {
    "perfusion": {
      "stress": "Moderate fixed perfusion defect involving the inferior and inferolateral walls (approximately 15% of the myocardium). Mild reversible defect in the lateral wall.",
      "rest": "Moderate fixed perfusion defect in the inferior and inferolateral walls, unchanged from stress. The lateral wall defect shows partial reversibility."

    "lungUptake": "Normal lung-to-heart ratio.",
    "tid": "Transient ischemic dilation ratio 1.08 (normal <1.22)."
  },
  "impression": [
    "Moderate fixed perfusion defect involving the inferior and inferolateral walls (approximately 15% of the myocardium), consistent with prior infarction in the RCA territory.",
    "Mild reversible perfusion defect in the lateral wall, suggesting mild peri-infarct ischemia or hibernating myocardium.",
    "Severely reduced left ventricular systolic function (LVEF 32%) with regional wall motion abnormalities.",
    "No evidence of significant ischemia in other coronary territories.",
    "Findings consistent with ischemic cardiomyopathy."

    "Continued optimal medical therapy for ischemic cardiomyopathy",
