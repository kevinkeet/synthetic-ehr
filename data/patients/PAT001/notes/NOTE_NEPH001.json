    "historyOfPresentIllness": "Mr. Morrison is a 72-year-old male with chronic kidney disease stage 3b (eGFR 35-40 mL/min/1.73m2) in the setting of diabetes and hypertension, referred for nephrology consultation for CKD management and evaluation of proteinuria.\n\nPatient's kidney function has been gradually declining over the past several years. His creatinine 5 years ago was approximately 1.4 mg/dL (eGFR ~50), and current creatinine is 1.9-2.0 mg/dL (eGFR 35-38). Most recent urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) was 180 mg/g, indicating moderately increased albuminuria (A2 category).\n\nPatient denies gross hematuria, foamy urine, flank pain, or urinary symptoms. He does have a history of nocturia (2-3 times per night) which is attributed to his BPH and diuretic use. He has never required dialysis or had an episode of acute kidney injury requiring intervention.\n\nHis CKD is presumed to be secondary to diabetic nephropathy and hypertensive nephrosclerosis given his long-standing history of both conditions. Renal ultrasound in 2021 showed bilateral small kidneys (9 cm bilaterally) with increased echogenicity consistent with chronic changes.",

Rate of decline approximately 2-3 mL/min/year based on historical data, which is consistent with expected progression.\n\nHis current management is appropriate with ACE inhibitor and SGLT2 inhibitor for nephroprotection. He does have several CKD-related complications developing including:\n1. Mild metabolic acidosis (HCO3 22)\n2. Mild anemia of CKD (Hgb 10.8)\n3. Secondary hyperparathyroidism (PTH 89)\n4. Mild hyperkalemia risk (K 4.9 on ACEi, spironolactone, and SGLT2i)",
