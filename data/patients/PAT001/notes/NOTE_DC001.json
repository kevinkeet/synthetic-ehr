    "hospitalCourse": "Mr. Morrison is a 72-year-old male with HFrEF (EF 30-35%), CKD3b, atrial fibrillation, and T2DM who was admitted with acute decompensated heart failure triggered by diuretic non-compliance.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:\n\nDay 1-2: Patient presented with volume overload evidenced by elevated JVP, bibasilar crackles, bilateral lower extremity edema, and elevated BNP (1,850). Chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly, vascular congestion, and small bilateral pleural effusions. Initiated IV diuresis with furosemide 40 mg IV q12h. Creatinine was elevated at 2.4 (baseline 1.8-2.0) consistent with cardiorenal syndrome. Held metformin and ACE inhibitor. Patient responded well to initial diuresis with 2.5L net negative on day 1.\n\nDay 2-3: Continued diuresis with good response. Net negative 2L daily. Creatinine peaked at 2.6 on day 2, then began trending down. Oxygen requirements improved from 2L NC to room air. Symptoms of dyspnea and orthopnea improved significantly. Weight down 3 kg from admission.\n\nDay 3-4: Transitioned to oral diuretics. Furosemide 60 mg PO BID with good effect. Creatinine improved to 2.1. Ambulating in hallways without dyspnea. Lower extremity edema reduced to 1+. Restarted lisinopril at 5 mg daily (reduced dose). Restarted metformin at half dose (250 mg BID). Heart rate controlled in 70s on carvedilol.\n\nDay 4 (Discharge): Patient at or near dry weight. Tolerating oral medications. Ambulating without dyspnea. Oxygen saturation 95% on room air. Discharge to home with close follow-up arranged.",
