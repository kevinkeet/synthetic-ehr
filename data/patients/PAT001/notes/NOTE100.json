Given severity of hemorrhage (Hgb drop to 5.8, required 4 units pRBC), high-risk ulcer characteristics, and patient's multiple bleeding risk factors (age >65, CKD, prior supratherapeutic INR), I am recommending AGAINST resuming anticoagulation. The risk of recurrent life-threatening GI hemorrhage outweighs stroke prevention benefit in this patient. Discussed with Dr. Wilson (Cardiology) who concurs. Will use aspirin 81mg daily for modest stroke risk reduction. Patient and wife counseled extensively about this decision and understand the trade-offs."

  "discussionNote": "MULTIDISCIPLINARY DISCUSSION: Extensive discussion held with patient, his wife Patricia, Dr. Wilson (Cardiology), and Dr. Torres (Nephrology). Patient's CHA2DS2-VASc score is 5 (high stroke risk), but HAS-BLED score is also very high given this major bleed, age, CKD, and prior labile INR. The severity of this hemorrhage (requiring ICU, 4 units blood, hemodynamic instability) tips the balance against anticoagulation. All parties agree that the bleeding risk currently outweighs stroke benefit. This may be revisited in 6-12 months if ulcer heals completely and no further bleeding, but for now anticoagulation is CONTRAINDICATED. Decision documented and communicated to PCP.",
