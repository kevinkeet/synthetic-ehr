    "historyOfPresentIllness": "Mr. Morrison is a 72-year-old gentleman with long-standing heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, last documented EF 30-35% in August 2023, who is referred for outpatient cardiology follow-up and optimization of heart failure therapy.\n\nPatient reports overall stability since his last hospitalization in August 2022 for CHF exacerbation. He has had no further hospitalizations. He denies significant dyspnea at rest, though he does experience exertional dyspnea after walking 1-2 blocks. He has been compliant with his medications and has not missed any doses of his diuretic. He weighs himself daily and has maintained his weight at approximately 94-95 kg. He follows a low-sodium diet and limits his fluid intake to 1.5 liters daily.\n\nHe does report intermittent bilateral lower extremity edema, typically worse at the end of the day, which improves overnight and with leg elevation. He denies orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He has occasional palpitations consistent with his known atrial fibrillation but denies sustained palpitations, lightheadedness, or syncope.\n\nHis last echocardiogram from August 2023 showed EF 30-35% with regional wall motion abnormalities (inferior and inferolateral akinesis), moderate mitral regurgitation, and severely dilated left atrium.",
