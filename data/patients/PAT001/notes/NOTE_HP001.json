    "historyOfPresentIllness": "Mr. Morrison is a 72-year-old male with a history of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF, EF 30-35%), Type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease stage 3b, and atrial fibrillation on warfarin who presents with progressive dyspnea on exertion and bilateral lower extremity edema over the past 3 days.\n\nPatient reports he was in his usual state of health until 3 days ago when he noticed increasing difficulty breathing when walking short distances. He normally can walk 1-2 blocks without stopping but now becomes short of breath after 20-30 feet. He also noticed that his legs have become progressively more swollen, and his shoes no longer fit comfortably. He denies any recent dietary indiscretions but admits to running out of his furosemide for the past 5 days due to a lapse in prescription refills.\n\nAssociated symptoms include orthopnea (now sleeping on 3 pillows vs his usual 2), paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea with 2 episodes over the past 2 nights, and a 5-pound weight gain over the past week. He denies chest pain, palpitations, fever, cough, or productive sputum. No recent illness exposures.\n\nHe denies any recent medication changes other than the missed furosemide doses. He has been compliant with his low-sodium diet and fluid restriction prior to this episode.",
